This Vim plug-in sets `&keywordprg` (see `:help K`) so that hitting the key `K` shows the documentation of the keyword under the cursor in

- `sh`, `zsh`, `powershell`, `batch`, ... files and
- common (`Unix`) configuration files, for example `~/.inputrc` and those of `Git`, `ZSH`, `SSH`, `GPG`, ...

If the passage shown in the manpage is not to the point, please hit `n` a few times till reaching the most relevant one.

To look up the current keyword in many file types by the graphical offline documentation browser [Zeal](http://www.zealdocs.org) as well, have a look at [vim-zeal](https://github.com/Konfekt/vim-zeal).
